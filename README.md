✅ Initial project setup completed.

✔️ Implemented the main entity classes: `Product`, `Category`, `Cart`, and `CartDetail`.  
✔️ Created `AppDbContext` with DbSets and Fluent API configurations for relationships.  
✔️ Generated and applied initial EF Core migrations.  
✔️ Added generic repositories and Unit of Work pattern.  
✔️ Developed services and controllers for both `Category` and `Product`.  
✔️ Integrated AutoMapper for DTO mapping.  
✔️ Organized the solution into four main layers:
- `Models`: Entity and DTO definitions
- `Datass`: Data access and EF configurations
- `Service`: Application logic and service layer
- `API`: Web API layer with controllers and endpoints  
✔️ Added `.gitignore` for proper version control hygiene.
